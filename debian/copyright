numpy/random/mtrand/initarray.c
    The following changes have been made to it in 2005 by Robert Kern:

      * init_by_array has been declared extern, has a void return, and uses the
        rk_state structure to hold its data.

     The original file has the following verbatim comments:

     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     The code in this module was based on a download from:
        http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/~matumoto/MT2002/emt19937ar.html

     It was modified in 2002 by Raymond Hettinger as follows:

      * the principal computational lines untouched except for tabbing.

      * renamed genrand_res53() to random_random() and wrapped
        in python calling/return code.

      * genrand_int32() and the helper functions, init_genrand()
        and init_by_array(), were declared static, wrapped in
        Python calling/return code.  also, their global data
        references were replaced with structure references.

      * unused functions from the original were deleted.
        new, original C python code was added to implement the
        Random() interface.

     The following are the verbatim comments from the original code:

     A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/1/26.
     Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.

     Before using, initialize the state by using init_genrand(seed)
     or init_by_array(init_key, key_length).

    This package was initially written for numarray by Paul F. Dubois
    at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
    In 2006, the package was completely rewritten by Pierre Gerard-Marchant
    (University of Georgia) to make the MaskedArray class a subclass of ndarray,
    and to improve support of structured arrays.

    Copyright 1999, 2000, 2001 Regents of the University of California.
    Released for unlimited redistribution.

    * Adapted for numpy_core 2005 by Travis Oliphant and (mainly) Paul Dubois.
    * Subclassing of the base ndarray 2006 by Pierre Gerard-Marchant
      (pgmdevlist_AT_gmail_DOT_com)
    * Improvements suggested by Reggie Dugard (reggie_AT_merfinllc_DOT_com)
