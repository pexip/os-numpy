Subject: Adapt SWIG documentation to Debian

 Location of `swig` directory in Debian is specific to our distro, so the
 documentation needs adaptation.

 Using numpy.i
 -------------
 
-The ``numpy.i`` file is currently located in the ``tools/swig``
-sub-directory under the ``numpy`` installation directory.  Typically,
-you will want to copy it to the directory where you are developing
-your wrappers.
+The ``numpy.i`` file is shipped in ``/usr/include/pythonVERSION/numpy`` in the
+``python3-numpy`` package where ``VERSION`` is the installed version of Python
+we're using. We can ask Python for this include path using this ``Makefile``
+snippet::
+
+    INCLUDEPY := $(shell python3 -c "import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_config_var('INCLUDEPY'))")
+
+    %.py %_wrap.cc: %.i
+            swig                   \
+              -I$(INCLUDEPY)/numpy \
+              -py3                 \
+              -python              \
+              -c++                 \
+              -outdir .            \
+              -o $*_wrap.cc        \
+              $<
+
+So if we have a swig module ``module.i``, we can build the swig wrappers with
+``make module.py module_wrap.cc``.
 
 A simple module that only uses a single `SWIG`_ interface file should
 include the following::
