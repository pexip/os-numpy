Information for Maintainers of packages depending on python3-numpy
------------------------------------------------------------------

With Numpy 1.4.1 upload in unstable, we had several packages failing
to execute due to a change in 'dtype' format (some fields were added
at the end of the data structure).

After that, we decided to provide a reliable way to specify strict
versioned depends on python3-numpy by the packages depending on it, in
order to avoid similar failures in future uploads.

python3-numpy provides a debhelper tool, dh_numpy3, that will add Numpy
dependencies to python3:Depends substvar; what dh_numpy3 does is:

* if the package is arch:all, a simple dependency on 'python3-numpy' is
  added;
* if the package is arch:any, two dependencies are added:
  * python3-numpy-abi$N, where N is the value for the current Numpy
    ABI, as defined by upstream C_ABI_VERSION value;
  * python3-numpy (>= $VER), where VER is the minimum python3-numpy
    package version implementing the current Numpy API, as defined by
    upstream C_API_VERSION value.
* if the package is arch:any and the '--strict' command-line option is
  passed to dh_numpy3, a dependency against python3-numpy-api$M is
  added, where M is the value for the current Numpy API, as defined by
  upstream C_API_VERSION value.

The current values for API, ABI and version are available in the file
/usr/share/numpy3/versions .

You should call dh_numpy3 regardless of the python helper you are using
in the package.
